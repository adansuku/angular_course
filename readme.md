# MyFirstApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

## Bindable Properties and Events

How do you know to which Properties or Events of HTML Elements you may bind? You can basically bind to all Properties and Events - a good idea is to `console.log()`  the element you're interested in to see which properties and events it offers.

**Important**: For events, you don't bind to onclick but only to click (=> (click)).

The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events of the element you're interested in. Googling for `YOUR_ELEMENT properties`  or `YOUR_ELEMENT events`  should yield nice results.


## Important: FormsModule is Required for Two-Way-Binding!

Important: For Two-Way-Binding (covered in the next lecture) to work, you need to enable the `ngModel`  directive. This is done by adding the `FormsModule`  to the `imports[]`  array in the AppModule.

You then also need to add the import from `@angular/forms`  in the app.module.ts file:

`import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';`
